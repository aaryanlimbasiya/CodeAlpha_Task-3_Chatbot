# CodeAlpha_Task-3_Chatbot
Here is my third task of CODEALPHA.

# Objective:

Create a text-based chatbot that can have conversations with users. You can use natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy to
make your chatbot more conversational.

# Key Points:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple chatbot using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer. The chatbot can respond to user inputs with relevant answers based on the provided text data. The key features of the 
project include:

Text Preprocessing: The raw text is converted to lowercase and tokenized into sentences and words.

Lemmatization: Words are lemmatized to their base form to ensure uniformity and improve response accuracy.

TF-IDF Vectorization: The text data is vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to measure the importance of words in the document.

Cosine Similarity: The similarity between the user input and the text data is calculated using cosine similarity to find the most relevant response.

Greeting Detection: The chatbot can recognize and respond to common greetings.

Fallback Response: If the chatbot doesn't understand the user input, it provides a fallback response indicating its inability to comprehend the query.

Interactive Interface: The chatbot runs in a loop, allowing continuous interaction with the user until they type "bye" to exit the conversation.
